    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const playersCopy = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    playersCopy[2] = "Rishabh";

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players)
    console.log(playersCopy)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    const playersCopyTwo = [...players];

    console.log(playersCopyTwo)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    playersCopyTwo[1] = "Rish";
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    
    console.log(players)
    console.log(playersCopyTwo)

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const personCopy = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    console.log(personCopy)
    personCopy["name"] = "Rishabh";
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    console.log(personCopy)
    console.log(person)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const personCopyTwo = Object.assign({}, person);
